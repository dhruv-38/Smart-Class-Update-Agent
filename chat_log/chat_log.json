            "After a thorough scan of your Smart-Class-Update-Agent project, here's a comprehensive analysis:\n\n## Project Overview\n\nThe Smart-Class-Update-Agent is a web application that integrates Google Classroom with Google Calendar. It helps students track their assignments and deadlines by automatically fetching data from Google Classroom and syncing it to Google Calendar.\n\n## Architecture\n\n1. **Backend (FastAPI)**\n   - Built with Python and FastAPI framework\n   - Handles Google OAuth authentication\n   - Fetches assignments and announcements from Google Classroom\n   - Uses Google Generative AI (Gemini) to extract deadlines from announcements\n   - Syncs events to Google Calendar\n\n2. **Frontend (React + Vite)**\n   - Modern React app built with Vite\n   - Uses Tailwind CSS for styling\n   - Communicates with backend via RESTful API calls\n   - Provides user interface to fetch and sync data\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Google Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 flow for secure access to user's Google resources\n2. **Assignment Tracking**: Fetches assignments from Google Classroom with due dates\n3. **Announcement Analysis**: Uses Gemini AI to extract deadlines from text announcements\n4. **Calendar Synchronization**: Creates events in Google Calendar with proper details\n5. **User Dashboard**: Shows statistics and data previews\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n### Backend\n\n1. **Google API Integration**:\n   - Uses Google API clients for Classroom and Calendar\n   - Proper OAuth flow implementation with scope control\n\n2. **AI Integration**:\n   - Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite model to extract deadlines from text\n   - Implements batch processing to optimize API calls\n\n3. **Data Processing**:\n   - Filters assignments by due dates (showing only future assignments)\n   - Formats dates and times appropriately\n   - Includes timezone handling (UTC to IST conversion)\n\n4. **Security**:\n   - CORS configuration with proper origin control\n   - Session management for authentication state\n   - Token validation and refresh mechanism\n\n### Frontend\n\n1. **Component Structure**:\n   - Clean separation of components\n   - Reusable UI elements like StatsCard\n   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS\n\n2. **API Integration**:\n   - Axios for HTTP requests\n   - Error handling and loading states\n   - Authentication state management\n\n3. **User Experience**:\n   - Toast notifications for user feedback\n   - Loading indicators\n   - Data previews in tables\n\n## Observations & Recommendations\n\n### Security Concerns\n\n1. **Hardcoded API Key**: The GEMINI_API_KEY is directly included in the ",
            " file that's visible in the repository.\n   - **Recommendation**: Remove the API key from the committed ",
            " file and add it to `.gitignore`.\n\n2. **Session Security**: The session secret key is hardcoded in ",
            ".\n   - **Recommendation**: Move the session secret key to environment variables.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n1. **Error Handling**: Most API calls have proper error handling, but some could be improved.\n\n2. **Environment Variables**: Good use of ",
            " file, but could implement better variable validation.\n\n3. **TypeScript**: Frontend could benefit from TypeScript for better type safety.\n\n### Performance\n\n1. **Data Caching**: Currently, data is stored in memory variables.\n   - **Recommendation**: Implement proper database storage for persistence.\n\n2. **Batch Processing**: Good implementation of batch processing for Gemini API calls.\n\n### Deployment Readiness\n\n1. **Configuration**: The current configuration is for development (localhost URLs).\n   - **Recommendation**: Add production configuration options.\n\n2. **Documentation**: Basic README files exist, but more comprehensive documentation would be helpful.\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\nThe Smart-Class-Update-Agent is a well-structured application with a clean architecture. The integration between Google Classroom and Calendar solves a real problem for students tracking deadlines. The AI integration for extracting deadlines from announcements is particularly innovative.\n\nWith some security enhancements and production-ready configurations, this project would be ready for wider deployment."

            "Let's also check how the app is being run to confirm the port: ",
            "The issue is with your Google OAuth configuration. When you set up OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console, the redirect URI must exactly match what your application is using. Based on the error and your code, here's what's happening:\n\n1. Your backend code is using: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/oauth2callback` as the redirect URI\n2. But your Google Cloud Console project likely has a different redirect URI configured\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n### Option 1: Update your Google Cloud Console settings\n\n1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Go to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\"\n3. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID and click to edit it\n4.

Click \"Save\"\n\n### Option 2: Update your backend code to use the configured redirect URI\n\nIf you prefer to keep your Google Cloud Console settings as they are, you can modify your backend code to use the exact redirect URI that's already configured. ",
            "Let me create a guide for you to fix this issue:\n\n### How to Fix \"redirect_uri_mismatch\" Error\n\nWhen you see \"Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch\" while trying to sign in with Google, it means the redirect URI in your application doesn't match what's configured in Google Cloud Console. Follow these steps to fix it:\n\n#### Option 1: Update Google Cloud Console (Recommended)\n\n1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Navigate to your project\n3. Go to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\"\n4. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID and click the edit button (pencil icon)\n5. Under \"Authorized redirect URIs\", add:\n   ```\n   http://127.0.0.1:8000/oauth2callback\n   ```\n6. Click \"Save\"\n7. Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate\n\n#### Option 2: View Your Current Configuration\n\nIf you want to see what redirect URIs are currently configured in your client_secret.json:\n\n```bash\ncd backend-agent\npython -c \"import json; f = open('client_secret.json'); data = json.load(f); print(data['web']['redirect_uris']); f.close()\"\n```\n\n#### Option 3: Update Your Backend Code\n\nIf you need to use a specific redirect URI that's already configured in Google Cloud Console, you can modify the backend code:\n\n1. Open ",
            "\n2. Find the ",
            " function\n3. Replace the dynamic redirect URI with the exact one from your Google Cloud Console:\n\n```python\n@app.get(\"/login\")\nasync def login(request: Request):\n    # Use the exact same redirect_uri as configured in Google Cloud Console\n    redirect_uri = \"YOUR_CONFIGURED_REDIRECT_URI\"  # e.g., \"https://example.com/oauth2callback\"\n    try:\n        auth_url, state = get_authorization_url(redirect_uri)\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=\"Failed to create authorization URL\")\n    request.session[\"state\"] = state\n    \n    return RedirectResponse(auth_url)\n```\n\nAlso update the callback function:\n\n```python\n@app.get(\"/oauth2callback\")\nasync def callback(request: Request, code: str, state: Optional[str] = None):\n    # ...\n    redirect_uri = \"YOUR_CONFIGURED_REDIRECT_URI\"  # Same as above\n    # ...\n```\n\n#### Option 4: Add Both Local and Production URIs\n\nFor development flexibility, add multiple redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console:\n- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/oauth2callback`\n- `http://localhost:8000/oauth2callback`\n- Any production URLs you might use\n\n#### Important Notes:\n\n1. The URI must match EXACTLY - including the protocol (http vs https), domain, port, and path\n2. After making changes in Google Cloud Console, it may take a few minutes for changes to propagate\n3. Make sure your backend is actually running on the port you specify (8000 in this case)\n\nLet me know which option you'd like to pursue, and I can provide more specific guidance if needed."

Using `localhost` consistently (instead of mixing `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`) helps avoid these redirect URI mismatch errors.\n\nIf you encounter any other issues, please let me know!"

            " and ",
            " to ensure dates and times are displayed in the user's preferred format\n\n2. **Updated Table Display**:\n   - Updated the date/time display in the data tables to use the new formatting function\n   - Added special handling for items with the new ",

Setting proper expectations about processing time\n2. Showing clear visual feedback during the entire process\n3. Preventing the impression that the application has frozen\n4. Providing meaningful error messages if the process fails\n\nYou should now restart your frontend server to see these changes in action. The next time you click \"Fetch Announcements,\" the UI will remain responsive and show progress indicators rather than appearing to freeze or showing a white screen."

Update the Main Application to Use the New Module\n\n```python\n# Update in backend-agent/src/main.py - import the new module\nfrom RAG.improved_extract_deadlines import extract_deadlines_from_announcements\n```\n\nThen update the announcement fetching endpoint:\n\n```python\n@app.get(\"/fetch-announcements\")\nasync def get_announcements(request: Request, credentials: dict = Depends(get_current_credentials)):\n    session_id = request.session.get(\"session_id\")\n    try:\n        from classroom_agent.fetch_announcements import fetch_announcements\n        \n        # Fetch announcements\n        announcements = fetch_announcements(credentials)\n        \n        # Store announcements\n        announcements_store[session_id] = announcements\n        \n        # Extract deadlines using our improved RAG-like approach\n        extracted_deadlines = extract_deadlines_from_announcements(announcements)\n        \n        # Store extracted deadlines\n        announcements_store[session_id] = {\n            \"announcements\": announcements,\n            \"extracted_deadlines\": extracted_deadlines\n        }\n        \n        return {\n            \"announcements\": announcements,\n            \"extracted_deadlines\": extracted_deadlines,\n            \"stats\": {\n                \"total_announcements\": len(announcements),\n                \"deadlines_found\": len(extracted_deadlines)\n            }\n        }\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f\"Failed to fetch announcements: {str(e)}\")\n```\n\n## Why This Approach Works Better\n\n1. **True RAG-Like Pattern**: \n   - **Retrieval**: We're filtering announcements based on keywords before sending to the LLM\n   - **Augmentation**: We're enhancing the prompt with clear instructions about what to extract\n   - **Generation**: The LLM generates structured deadline data from the filtered context\n\n2. **Efficiency Improvements**:\n   - Keyword filtering reduces the number of announcements processed\n   - Batch processing reduces API calls\n   - Improved JSON parsing handles various response formats\n\n3. **Better Prompt Engineering**:\n   - Clear, detailed instructions for the LLM\n   - Structured format for the response\n   - Examples of what to look for (dates, times, specific phrases)\n\n4. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**:\n   - Comprehensive logging at each step\n   - Better error catching and reporting\n   - Graceful fallbacks when parsing fails\n\n## Testing and Implementation\n\nTo implement this approach:\n\n1. Create the new `improved_extract_deadlines.py` file in your RAG folder\n2. Update the imports and endpoint in `main.py`\n3. Test with your existing announcements\n4. Monitor the logs to see how many announcements are being filtered and how many deadlines are found\n\nThis implementation follows your requested approach:\n- Load all announcements in memory\n- Use keyword filtering as a simple retrieval step\n- \"Stuff\" the filtered announcements into the context for the LLM\n\nThe key improvement is in how we structure the prompt and parse the response, which should significantly improve the accuracy of deadline extraction."

First filters announcements to find only potentially relevant ones using keywords\n2. Then processes these announcements in batches using the Gemini API\n3. Uses your specific prompt to extract deadline information\n4. Properly handles the response and builds a structured list of deadlines\n\nThis should significantly improve the quality of deadline extraction from your classroom announcements while reducing unnecessary API calls for irrelevant content."

If your filtered announcements contain a lot of text, you might hit the token limit for a single API call. The maximum context length for gemini-2.0-flash-lite is 32,000 tokens.\n\nIf you find that you're hitting token limits, you would need to revert to the batching approach. However, for most classroom announcement datasets, this single-call approach should work fine, especially after filtering out irrelevant announcements.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Replace your current `extract_deadlines.py` file with this updated version\n2. Make sure your `.env` file contains a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY`\n3. Test the function with a small set of announcements first\n4. Monitor the logs to ensure the filtering is working as expected\n5. Check the quality of extracted deadlines to ensure they meet your needs\n\nThis implementation maintains the core RAG-like pattern while eliminating batching as requested:\n1. **Retrieval**: Filtering announcements based on relevant keywords\n2. **Generation**: Using Gemini to extract structured deadline information"

Found a total of {len(all_deadlines)} deadlines from {len(announcements)} announcements\")\n    return all_deadlines\n```\n\nThis modification:\n1. Removes the batching logic completely\n2. Calls extract_deadlines_from_batch() once with all filtered announcements\n3. Simplifies the code by removing batch tracking, delays, and progress reporting\n4. Still keeps the filtering step to reduce the amount of data sent to the API\n\nThe extract_deadlines_from_batch function will work the same way, but now it will process all filtered announcements at once. Just be aware that if you have a large number of announcements, you might hit token limits with the Gemini API. The current implementation should work fine for most classroom announcement datasets."

Replace your ",

Check the detailed logs to see what's happening with the state parameter\n\nIf the issue persists, look at the debug output in the terminal and the error response, which should provide more details about what's happening with the state parameter."

Created `oauth_states` dictionary to store valid states server-side\n   - This avoids relying on client-side cookies which can be lost during redirects\n\n2. **State Validation**:\n   - Validates state directly against the server-side store\n   - Adds detailed debug information to error responses\n\n3. **URL Handling**:\n   - Consistently replaces \"127.0.0.1\" with \"localhost\" in all URLs\n   - Ensures the authorization_response URL matches the registered redirect URI\n\n4. **Session Handling**:\n   - Creates a new session ID only after successful authentication\n   - This ensures we don't create unused session IDs\n\nThis approach is more robust because it doesn't rely on the session being maintained between the initial request and the callback. Instead, it keeps track of valid state values server-side.\n\n## To Fix the Issue:\n\n1. Replace your `/login` and `/oauth2callback` endpoints with the ones provided above\n2. Add the `oauth_states` dictionary at the top of your file\n3. Restart your backend server\n4. Try the login process again\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues, it would be helpful to:\n1. Check if your Google OAuth credentials in the Cloud Console have the exact redirect URI: `http://localhost:8000/oauth2callback`\n2. Try clearing your browser cookies and cache\n3. Test in an incognito/private browsing window\n\nThis should resolve the \"Invalid state parameter\" error you're encountering."

            "# Avoiding Duplicate Deadlines Between Announcements and Assignments\n\nGreat question! You need a mechanism to ensure that deadlines extracted from announcements don't duplicate assignments already fetched from the Google Classroom API.

This preserves the different structures of each data source\n\n3. **Clear Instructions to AI**:\n   - The prompt clearly specifies that assignments have priority\n   - Asks only for indices of extracted deadlines to keep\n\n4. **Improved Response Parsing**:\n   - Enhanced to handle different response formats from the AI\n   - Better error handling for malformed responses\n\nThis approach respects the different data structures and gives priority to assignments, exactly as you requested."

            " from the ",
            " module and use it correctly.\n\nI've made these changes:\n\n1. **Fixed the time creation**:\n   - Added proper error handling around time parsing\n   - Used the correct syntax for creating a time object\n\n2. **Added better error handling**:\n   - Added try-except blocks around time parsing\n   - Added specific error types (ValueError, IndexError)\n   - Added error logging\n\n## Alternative Fix\n\nIf you prefer, you can also fix this by updating your imports at the top of the file:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, time\nimport pytz\n```\n\nThen change the time creation line to:\n```python\ntime_obj = time(hour=hour, minute=minute)\n```\n\nEither approach will solve the error you're seeing with the time method."

This should improve the user experience by preventing the calendar from being cluttered with outdated events."

I've fixed that by including only one import statement.\n\nThis LoadingSpinner component is now properly formatted with:\n1. A single React import statement\n2. Support for different sizes and colors\n3. Optional message display\n4. Two display modes: inline or fullscreen overlay\n\nThe component should now load without any errors."

            "# Endpoint to delete a calendar event\n@app.delete(\"/calendar-event/{event_id}\")\nasync def delete_calendar_event(\n    event_id: str, \n    request: Request, \n    credentials: dict = Depends(get_current_credentials)\n):\n    \"\"\"Delete a specific calendar event by ID\"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Build the Google Calendar API client\n        from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials\n        from googleapiclient.discovery import build\n        \n        # Create credentials object from the provided token\n        creds = Credentials(\n            token=credentials['token'],\n            refresh_token=credentials.get('refresh_token'),\n            scopes=credentials.get('granted_scopes')\n        )\n        \n        service = build('calendar', 'v3', credentials=creds)\n        \n        # Delete the event\n        service.events().delete(calendarId='primary', eventId=event_id).execute()\n        \n        # Return success response\n        return {\"status\": \"success\", \"message\": f\"Event {event_id} deleted successfully\"}\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        # Log the error details for debugging\n        print(f\"Error deleting calendar event {event_id}: {str(e)}\")\n        # Return error response with details\n        raise HTTPException(\n            status_code=500,\n            detail=f\"Failed to delete event: {str(e)}\"\n        )\n```\n\nThe issue is likely due to missing credentials handling in the delete endpoint. The fix adds:\n\n1. **Proper Credentials Object Creation**:\n   - The endpoint now properly creates a Google OAuth2 Credentials object from the provided token\n\n2. **Better Error Handling**:\n   - Added error logging to help diagnose issues\n   - Added proper HTTP exception raising with details\n\n3. **Success Response**:\n   - The endpoint now returns a success response with a status and message\n\nAfter making this change to the delete endpoint, the frontend should be able to successfully delete calendar events.\n\n## Frontend Fix (Optional)\n\nIf you want to improve error handling on the frontend side as well, you can update the `handleDeleteEvent` function in your DashboardView component:\n\n```jsx\n// Handle calendar event deletion\nconst handleDeleteEvent = async (eventId) => {\n  try {\n    // Show loading indicator\n    toast.info('Deleting event...', { autoClose: 2000 });\n    \n    // Make the API call\n    await axios.delete(`${BACKEND_URL}/calendar-event/${eventId}`);\n    \n    // Remove the deleted event from state\n    setCalendarEvents(prev => prev.filter(event => event.id !== eventId));\n    \n    // Update stats\n    setStats(prev => ({\n      ...prev,\n      totalEvents: prev.totalEvents - 1\n    }));\n    \n    // Show success message\n    toast.success('Event deleted successfully');\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error deleting event:', error);\n    \n    // Show a more detailed error message\n    const errorMessage = error.response?.data?.detail || 'Failed to delete event';\n    toast.error(`Error: ${errorMessage}`);\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThis improved frontend function:\n1. Shows a loading indicator during deletion\n2. Displays the specific error message from the backend if available\n3. Makes the error handling more robust\n\nWith these changes, calendar event deletion should work correctly, and you'll get better feedback when errors occur."

Let's address both sides:\n\n## 1. First, let's check the backend endpoint for creating events:\n\n```python\n",

Now, let's update the frontend CalendarEventsList component to properly format the date and time:\n\n```jsx\n",
            "// Handle form submission\nconst handleSubmit = (e) => {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  \n  // Validate the date format (should be YYYY-MM-DD)\n  if (!newEvent.date.match(/^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$/)) {\n    alert(\"Please enter a valid date in YYYY-MM-DD format\");\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  // Validate the time format if provided (should be HH:MM)\n  if (newEvent.time && !newEvent.time.match(/^\\d{2}:\\d{2}$/)) {\n    alert(\"Please enter a valid time in HH:MM format\");\n    return;\n  }\n  \n  // Create the event object in the format expected by the backend\n  const eventData = {\n    title: newEvent.title,\n    description: newEvent.description || \"\",\n    date: newEvent.date,\n    time: newEvent.time || null,\n    type: 'custom'\n  };\n  \n  onAddEvent(eventData);\n  \n  // Reset form\n  setNewEvent({\n    title: '',\n    description: '',\n    date: '',\n    time: '',\n    type: 'custom',\n  });\n  setShowAddForm(false);\n};\n```\n\n## 3. Let's also update the `handleAddEvent` function in DashboardView.jsx for better error handling:\n\n```jsx\n",
            "// Handle adding a custom event\nconst handleAddEvent = async (eventData) => {\n  try {\n    // Show loading indicator\n    toast.info('Adding event...', { autoClose: 2000 });\n    \n    console.log('Sending event data:', eventData); // Debug log\n    \n    const response = await axios.post(`${BACKEND_URL}/calendar-event`, eventData);\n    \n    if (response.data && response.data.id) {\n      // Add the new event to state\n      setCalendarEvents(prev => [...prev, response.data]);\n      \n      // Update stats\n      setStats(prev => ({\n        ...prev,\n        totalEvents: prev.totalEvents + 1\n      }));\n      \n      toast.success('Event added successfully');\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error adding event:', error);\n    \n    // Show a more detailed error message\n    const errorMessage = error.response?.data?.detail || 'Failed to add event';\n    toast.error(`Error: ${errorMessage}`);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## 4. Let's ensure the date and time inputs are in the correct format:\n\n```jsx\n",
            "// In the form section for date and time inputs:\n\n<div>\n  <label htmlFor=\"date\" className=\"block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700\">\n    Date *\n  </label>\n  <input\n    type=\"date\"\n    name=\"date\"\n    id=\"date\"\n    required\n    className=\"mt-1 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500 block w-full shadow-sm sm:text-sm border-gray-300 rounded-md\"\n    value={newEvent.date}\n    onChange={handleInputChange}\n  />\n  <p className=\"mt-1 text-xs text-gray-500\">Format: YYYY-MM-DD</p>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n  <label htmlFor=\"time\" className=\"block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700\">\n    Time (optional)\n  </label>\n  <input\n    type=\"time\"\n    name=\"time\"\n    id=\"time\"\n    className=\"mt-1 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500 block w-full shadow-sm sm:text-sm border-gray-300 rounded-md\"\n    value={newEvent.time}\n    onChange={handleInputChange}\n  />\n  <p className=\"mt-1 text-xs text-gray-500\">Format: HH:MM (24-hour)</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Common Issues and Fixes:\n\n1. **Date Format Issue**: The HTML date input will output dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, but depending on browser settings, it might not. Our validation ensures this format.\n\n2. **Time Format Issue**: Similarly, the time input should give HH:MM format.\n\n3. **Missing Fields**: The backend requires at least 'title' and 'date'. We've added validation for these.\n\n4. **CORS Issues**: If you're still having problems, it could be a CORS issue. The backend should allow requests from your frontend origin.\n\nThese changes should fix the 400 Bad Request error when adding events. The key improvements are:\n- Better validation on both frontend and backend\n- Better error handling and feedback\n- Debug logging to help troubleshoot\n\nIf you're still having issues, please inspect the network request in your browser's developer tools to see exactly what data is being sent to the backend."

            "import google_auth_oauthlib.flow\nimport os\n\n# Set this environment variable to enable insecure transport for local development only\nos.environ['OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT'] = '1'\n\nCLIENT_SECRETS_FILE = \"client_secret.json\"\nSCOPES = [\n    \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courses.readonly\",\n    \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.announcements.readonly\",\n    \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.student-submissions.me.readonly\",\n    \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events\"\n]\n\ndef get_flow(redirect_uri, state=None):\n    if state:\n        flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.Flow.from_client_secrets_file(\n            CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE, scopes=SCOPES, state=state)\n    else:\n        flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.Flow.from_client_secrets_file(\n            CLIENT_SECRETS_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)\n    flow.redirect_uri = redirect_uri\n    return flow\n\ndef get_authorization_url(redirect_uri):\n    flow = get_flow(redirect_uri)\n    authorization_url, state = flow.authorization_url(\n        access_type='offline',\n        include_granted_scopes='true'\n    )\n    return authorization_url, state\n\ndef fetch_token(redirect_uri, state, authorization_response):\n    flow = get_flow(redirect_uri, state)\n    flow.fetch_token(authorization_response=authorization_response)\n    credentials = flow.credentials\n    return {\n        'token': credentials.token,\n        'refresh_token': credentials.refresh_token,\n        'granted_scopes': credentials.granted_scopes\n    }\n```\n\n## Important Security Warning\n\n⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This setting (`OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1`) should ONLY be used for local development. It bypasses an important security check that ensures OAuth flows happen over HTTPS. Never use this in production environments.\n\n## Why This Works\n\nThis solution works because it:\n\n1. Allows OAuth2 to work over HTTP instead of requiring HTTPS\n2. Makes development easier without requiring SSL certificates locally\n3. Preserves the security checks in production environments\n\nAfter making this change, restart your backend server and try logging in again. The OAuth flow should now complete successfully without the \"insecure_transport\" error.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Restart your backend server\n2. Try logging in again\n3. After successful login, test the calendar event creation to make sure it works properly\n\nFor a production deployment, you should:\n1. Remove this environment variable setting\n2. Configure proper HTTPS with SSL certificates\n3. Update redirect URLs to use HTTPS"

When the user selects a time like 10:00 AM, the input will store it as \"10:00\".\n2. The `adjustTimeForBackend` function keeps the time as is, but ensures it's in the correct format.\n3. The time is sent to the backend exactly as the user entered it.\n4. The backend then handles the time zone context when creating the event.\n\nThis approach ensures the time the user sees on the form is the same time that appears in their calendar."

Ensures the result is always a valid 24-hour time format\n\nFor example:\n- If you enter 10:00 AM IST (UTC+5:30), the function will correctly calculate 04:30 AM UTC\n- If you enter 03:00 AM IST, the function will correctly calculate 21:30 PM UTC (previous day)\n\nThis should now correctly handle the time zone conversion from your local time to UTC for the backend."
